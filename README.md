- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @r0b3rtf1sh3r, 
From New Zealand, 45 years old, been doing game development for the last 2 years on indy solo project, 
Tried to do java at university in early 2000's (stuck to visual basic / scripts / modding) was into competetive gaming with a long comp history, 
I always wanted to make games since i was 10, when i had my first commodore and learnt basic/turtle/logo , but was put off by its lack of "game design driven elements" or any learning institutions supporting "games" in general. 
until i found blueprints. Blueprints changed the game for me, As a visual learner I can itterate prototypes and concepts really fast. then learn the syntax for the equivelant and kinda hack n slash my way through learning c++ in the proceess. 
Im in awe of the open source community and epic's unreal engine suite of tools. they are truly tools for artists and developers to "unreal worlds" 

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ...ww2,games development,comp fps,android xda testing,linux,fishing,heavy metal music, drumming among other cool things. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...UE5,linux via (nobara 42), github
- ðŸ“« How to reach me ... im around
